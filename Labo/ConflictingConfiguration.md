#ã€€Conflicting Configuration

You can review the devices that are "Not Ready" state in the *Not Ready* tab.

Some of the reasons why they are not ready are conflinting configurations. The specific registry values prevent Windows from updating properly. Those registry keys should be removed to resolve the conflict, however, other services could write back the registry keys. It's recommended that you review common sources for conflicting configurations to ensure your devices continue to receive Windows Updates.
