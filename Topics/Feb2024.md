## Customer defined service outcomes in preview
Deployment success measures were based on a static schedule of 21 days, however, the success of Windows Autopatch deployments will be based on your defined rings with this enhancement. In addition, you can check the percentage complete for QU and FQ by rings. Based on the report, you can understand the trend by rings.

## Improved data refresh speed and reporting accuracy
This release is changing the refresh cycle for Windows Autopatch reporting. Previously it took 24 hours until the update status will be updated, however, this time will be reduced to 30 minutes. This helps IT admins to control non-compliant devices in a timely manner.
