# Why Windows Autopatch?
Windows Autopatch helps IT admins to keep your organization's devices updated. Before learning Windows Autopatch, letâ€™s quickly look back exisiting Windows update management tools, WSUS and Configuration manager.
(12/28/2023 Added Windows Update for Business part since Windows Autopatch is based on WUfB service.)

## Comparison with WSUS
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is a server role that allows IT administrators to manage and distribute updates to Windows clients in a corporate environment. WSUS downloads updates from Microsoft Update or an intranet server and distributes them to client computers. IT administrators can approve or decline updates before they are installed on client computers. This ensures that only approved updates are installed on client computers, which helps to maintain system stability and security. 
WSUS also helps to reduce network bandwidth usage by downloading updates once and distributing them to client computers, rather than having each client computer download updates from the internet.
IT administrators need to check new updates and decide which updates should or shouldn't be instolled on client computers.
This is one of the popular methods.

## Comparison with Configuration manager
CM provides a centralized console for managing software updates, which allows IT administrators to deploy software updates to client computers in a controlled and automated manner.
IT administrators are required in-depth knowledge to master CM such as Manual deployment, automatic deployment and phased deployment.

Windows Update for Business doesn't require on-premise servers such as WSUS server. The Windows clients will source contents from Windows Update for Business server over internet.
